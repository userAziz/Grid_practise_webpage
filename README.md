# Grid_practise_webpage
In this project, I tried to understand fully conceptions of Grid and used Bootstrap(css library), SASS, fetching data from JSON file, and etc...

First I coded with HTML and CSS then I changed CSS to SASS and simplify HTML codes. After just creating certain page. I used movie API and fetch it and saved my js file.
It helped to understand the fully meaning of the how to fetch Data by using JS and display it in the main page.
